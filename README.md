# ML Breast Cancer Classifier
A hands-on project using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.  
The goal is to build a clear and well-documented baseline for classification, while keeping the workflow reproducible and easy to follow.


## Motivation
This repository is part of my learning journey to strengthen both my machine learning and engineering skills.  
Beyond just training models, the focus is on developing habits that matter in real projects:  
- understanding data through EDA,  
- building reliable pipelines, and  
- keeping experiments reproducible and transparent.


## About the Dataset

This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, originally hosted by the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)).

* **Samples**: 569
* **Features**: 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
* **Target**: Diagnosis (`malignant` or `benign`).

The features capture morphological characteristics of the cell nuclei visible in the images (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, smoothness, concavity).
These measurements are commonly used in research on diagnostic support systems for breast cancer.

The dataset was introduced in the early 1990s in the context of work on linear programming approaches to classification.
It has since become a benchmark dataset for evaluating classical machine learning models.
